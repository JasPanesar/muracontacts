# muracontacts

## Please Note
This is intended for Mura CMS (v7+) training purposes only. It should **not** to be used for production purposes.

## Instructions
Each branch of [this project](https://github.com/stevewithington/muracontacts) is intended to be an example of how to use Mura ORM with a custom display object.

Switch to the desired branch, download it, and place entire directory under the theme's `display_objects` directory. For example:
`{SiteID}/includes/themes/{ThemeName}/display_objects/muracontacts`

A new display object option should appear in the list of available display objects when using **Inline Edit** mode. Simply drag it onto the layout in the desired display region and publish.
